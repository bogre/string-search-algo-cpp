String searching algorithms, pattern proccessing in c++

## Rolling hash algorithm
### Polynomial hashes
For this algo to implement efficiently we need to set parameters:
- Alphabet size, number of different characters in string we are searching (n)
- Prime number to choose for modulus operation, in order to reduce collision to
  achieve at least TCR requirement
- Pattern length (p)
